## 📖 About
```ascii
> A calculator in Python with functions to perform arithmetic operations.
```

<br>

## ❔ How it works
```ascii
 ● The first field will appear, asking you to enter the first number;
 ● After the first, the second field will also ask for the second number;
 ● Then the two numbers will be calculated in the four arithmetic operations.
```
**Note: in multiplication and division, numbers will be calculated as powers and whole divisions, respectively.**
